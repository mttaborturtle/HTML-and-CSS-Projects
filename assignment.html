			<h1>Dogs</h1>
			<h3>Dogs are the greatest!</h3>
			<p>I'm a big fan of dogs. They are truly man's best friend! They will love you unconditionally. My dog is a Labradoodle. Labradoodles were bred to be hypo-allergenic, as well as have the best traits of a Lab as well as a Poodle. My dog is the best! She is loving, loyal, and a total sweetheart. Below is a picture of my dog Stella Blue.</p>

			<br><p>Here is a quote from Wikipedia about Labradoodles:</p>
			<blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labradoodle">A Labradoodle (/ˈlæbrəduːdəl/) is a crossbreed dog created by crossing the Labrador Retriever and the Standard, Miniature, or Toy poodle. The term first appeared in 1955, but was not initially popular. Labradoodles are considered a good choice for people with canine dander allergies, since some have the same hypoallergenic coat as their poodle ancestors</blockquote>
