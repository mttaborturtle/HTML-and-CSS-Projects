# HTML-and-CSS-Projects
## My Tech Academy web projects.

This repository is where I will be storing all of my projects from the HTML and CSS course at The Tech Academy.

# Projects:

## HotelINspace
This is a website I created for a hotel that lives in space. I styled it using CSS and contains a navbar, containers for images, and a contact form.

## Cinema Site
This is a one page website created using Bootstrap 4. It uses many Bootstrap elements including a navbar, jumbotron, contact form, cards, and a droptown.

## One Page Website
This is a one page website that features my dog and other Labradoodles. It incorperates CSS elements to style the page and make it look uniform.

## mttaborturtle.com
This is my final HTML/CSS project. It has been uploaded to a web hosting server and is accesable by going to mttaborturtle.com. It uses all things I learned and features a navbar, image containers, contact form, and lots of cool effects via CSS.

## Various other tidbits
Feel free to look around and see the things I have created during my course study in HTML/CSS. You will be able to find all sorts of .html pages and snippits of .css files. You will find navbars, forms, and tables, all that I created by scratch.
