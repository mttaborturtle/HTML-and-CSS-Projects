			<h1>Dogs</h1>
			<h3>Dogs are the greatest!</h3>
			<p>I'm a big fan of dogs. They are truly man's best friend! They will love you unconditionally. My dog is a Labradoodle. Labradoodles were bred to be hypo-allergenic, as well as have the best traits of a Lab as well as a Poodle. My dog is the best! She is loving, loyal, and a total sweetheart. Below is a picture of my dog Stella Blue.</p>
